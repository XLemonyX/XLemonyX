# Hi! üë®‚Äçüî¨
I'm passionate about Data Analysis, Statistics, and Data Visualisation. This repo holds some of my work that showcases how I go around data analysis and visualisation. If you wish to seek more about me, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-g-12ba74232/).

# My Projects:

### 1. Pet Supplies
Tools: MS Excel, SQL, Google Sheets

Skills: Data Visualisation, Statistics, Data Cleaning and Analysis

Output: Written analysis

Pet Box Subscription analysis is a descriptive analysis of a pet store, which was done for my Data Analyst Associate certification. Goal of this projest was to clean, analyse an visualise data in a clear, understandable way and draw correct conclusions using three different visualisation showing distribution and relationship within data. Data was cleaned and prepared with MS Excel. Data visualization is done with Google Sheets. 

My final submission consisted of a written report for Data Analyst at Data Camp, who reviewed my proposal and reviewed that the analysis meets current industry standards. You can view it [here](https://github.com/XLemonyX/XLemonyX/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).

### 2. Analyzing Students' Mental Health
Tools: SQL, Python

Skills: Data Visualisation, Statistics, Data Analysis

Output: Written analysis

In this project I analize Students' mental health data. Goal of this projest was to explore the students data using PostgreSQL to find out if international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor. Analysis was done using SQL and Python which was also used for visualisaton using Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Pollution Analysis Project  
Tools: Power BI, SQL  
Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, SQL Queries  

## Project Overview  
The **Pollution Analysis** project focuses on analyzing air pollution data at both the global and local levels, specifically focusing on countries, cities, and their corresponding population sizes. The project combines data from publicly available sources to uncover patterns and insights related to air quality and the impact of pollution.

The primary goal of this project was to clean, analyze, and visualize air pollution data to provide a clearer understanding of air quality trends and the factors that contribute to pollution levels in various regions. The dataset includes air quality indicators like PM10 and CO2 levels, and population data for cities with populations over 500,000, which were merged and processed using SQL queries.  

The analysis involves detailed calculations and breakdowns by country and city, allowing for a comparative look at pollution levels across various regions. The results were then visualized using Power BI, with multiple charts highlighting key data points, relationships, and trends within the air quality metrics.

The final deliverable includes visualizations and a detailed report summarizing key findings, such as the regions with the highest pollution and the factors contributing most to air pollution. This project was submitted for review to Data Camp as part of the Data Analyst certification program, where it was evaluated for industry standard analysis and visualization techniques.
